        <p>I am a Website Designer, Graphice Designer, Gadgets Engineer and Tech Enthusiasm. 
            I'm currently working on a project which i called my Portfolio. 
            But i really wish there is a way i  could learn this faster 
            but there is not a way so i guess i would just stick to learning it little 
            by little You might be wondering what is he doing but trust me i'm doing great
